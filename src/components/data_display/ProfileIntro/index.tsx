              I am a Software Engineer with 6+ years experience in remote work
              and 10+ years with web technologies. I'm fast-learner that loves

              I graduated in Computer Science in 2014 and got my Masterâ€™s degree
              in 2017, both from the Universidade Federal do EspÃ­rito Santo
              (UFES). And since I started to work remotely, I have been in
              companies from the USA, Brazil, Switzerland, and London and worked
              with different technologies such as React, React Native, Redux,
              TypeScript, NextJS, GraphQL, Gatsby, Tailwind CSS, Material UI,
              NodeJS, Firebase, MongoDB, and MySQL. At the moment, I am a Senior
              Frontend Developer at Scope3.
